    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at
         achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and 
         character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
           of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.
            Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student
             while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly 
             different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the 
             product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by
              educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural
               heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners,
                 skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

        There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners.

        In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner. If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.[71] For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.[72]
